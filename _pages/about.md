## Hello, and welcome to my homepage!

I am a researcher in **environmental physical chemistry**, currently in the final year of my PhD at the **Soil Chemistry Laboratory**, **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev**, under the supervision of **Dr. Gilboa Arye**. My doctoral research focuses on the **physico-chemical interactions between biosurfactants and water-repellent porous media**, employing both experimental approaches and transport modeling. The broader aim of my work is to advance the understanding of **wettability and water dynamics in peat-based horticultural substrates**, contributing to sustainable water management practices in controlled growing systems.

I hold a Master’s degree in **Environmental Soil Chemistry** (awarded *CUM LAUDE*) from Ben-Gurion University, where I investigated the **surface-active behavior of plant xylem sap at the liquid–air interface**. My academic foundation lies in **agricultural sciences**, with a Bachelor's degree from Rai Technology University, India. During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a summer research internship at Ben-Gurion University, which inspired my long-term academic and scientific pursuits in soil systems, plant-environment interactions, and sustainable agronomy.

Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in diverse research topics including:

- Interfacial behavior of **surfactants and amphiphilic molecules** at solid–liquid–air interfaces  
- **Adsorption–desorption kinetics** of chemical solutes in porous media  
- **Solute transport modeling** under saturated and variably saturated flow conditions

I have presented my research at both national (Israel) and international platforms, including multiple appearances at the **EGU General Assembly**, and have contributed to peer-reviewed publications, including a **book chapter on traditional water purification methods**. Additional first-author manuscripts are currently in preparation or under review.

In parallel to my research, I maintain a strong interest in **geopolitics**, with a particular focus on its influence on **global trade**, **sustainability transitions**, and **resource governance**. I have pursued certifications in **data analysis (Python, R)**, **machine learning**, **solute transport modeling (HYDRUS 1D/2D/3D)**, and **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) frameworks**, reflecting my interdisciplinary approach to scientific inquiry.

This website provides an overview of my ongoing research, academic contributions, and broader intellectual interests. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content insightful.
