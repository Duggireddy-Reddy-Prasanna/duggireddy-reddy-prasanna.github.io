This project applied spatial analysis techniques in **ArcGIS Pro** to investigate the interaction between vegetation cover, topography, and hydrological features. Key tasks included:

- Generating a **vegetation cover classification map**
- Creating **stream buffer zones** at fixed distances
- Performing **intersect analysis** to overlay vegetation and elevation data
- Extracting area summaries by **land cover type** using **spatial statistics**
- Designing a composite layout with legends, charts, and maps

<mark>Tools used:</mark> *Buffer, Intersect, Clip, Field Calculator, Symmetrical Difference, Spatial Join, Zonal Statistics, Layout Designer.*
